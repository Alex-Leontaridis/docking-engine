PROJECT CONTEXT: Binding & Docking Insight Engine (Phase 2 – Convexia)

This project aims to extend our docking pipeline into a pharma-style insight engine. 
The system should be able to:
- Integrate multiple ML models for pose prediction and affinity estimation
- Parse molecular interactions and evaluate druggability
- Compute consensus and confidence scores across models
- Output interpretable results in both CSV and JSON formats

Goals:
- Improve the interpretability, reliability, and scientific rigor of compound screening
- Make results decision-ready for medicinal chemists and drug discovery teams
- Ensure fallback mechanisms and robust error handling at every step

Model Roles:
- DiffDock, EquiBind, NeuralPLexer-2, UMol: Pose prediction
- Boltz2: Binding affinity (ΔG) prediction
- AlphaFold2, OpenFold, ESMFold: Protein structure prediction (if PDB is missing)
- PLIP (and RDKit fallback): Interaction parsing
- Fpocket: Druggability scoring
- Consensus + Confidence: Use RMSD, druggability, efficiency, and agreement between models

Expected Outputs:
- Structured `final_summary.csv` for downstream analysis
- Per-ligand `summary.json` for consumption by insight dashboards or LLM agents

The agent must be able to reason across heterogeneous model outputs, resolve conflicts, and produce scientifically valid, interpretable scores and summaries.

This is part of Convexia’s internal research pipeline for decision-making at scale.
